# Who Am I?

My name is Qing Lan, a Graduated Software/Mechatronics Engineer. Currently I am doing my degree in Columbia University in the area of Computer Engineering. After Being professional in building hardware-based software system, I began to discover more on the software related field and that is my interests! Currently working on the GYM management DBMS and a M.E.A.N Web application development, will update this page in December.
