# Who Am I?

My name is Qing Lan, a Graduated Software/Mechatronics Engineer. I have received my First Class Honor fron University of Liverpool with an additional Awards (with 100 Pounds) for best Final Year Project. Currently I am doing my degree in Columbia University in the area of Computer Engineering.


## Hardware projects (2013-2016)
- Craze-file Drone Wireless Charging Research (NI Multisim, Small Drone)
- Mechatronics Fish Control Logic Design (NI LabView, first contact with sensors)
- Home Alarm System (Arduino, Infrared Sensor, Bluetooth Module)
- Temperature Sensing System (Purely Digital Circuit! DAC-ADC conversion)
- Space Gloves (C# 3D model, Gyroscope, Flex-sensor, Bluetooth)
- Kossel 3D Printer (Personal Project, Delta-robot, Arduino, Motors and C programming)
- Sensing Touch Robotic System (Final Year Project, ROS nodes receiving data, TCP/UDP Communication analysis, Server/Client, Multi-threading)

## Software Projects (2016-2017)

### Web/Android Developer
- Columbia Cloud GYM (First try on Front-end, Back-end with PostgreSQL, Python Flask, Google Compute Engine and JQuergy)
- Stock Web Application (NodeJS with Express, MongoDB, AngularJS and Bootstrap)
- Hetnet! A Android Middleware to provide seamless Network connections (Java, Android APIs, Event-based Architecture, MEAN Front-end, backend) This project is a research project directed by Prof.Henning Schulzrinne

### Dig-in-deep Math!
- Circline-An Easy Graph Language (build Scanner, Parser, Semantic Check and Code Generation on Ocaml)
- Amazon Alexa with enhaced skill sets (Ongoing...Aimed to be better than Amazon DOT! Raspberry PI zero, backend)
- Voice Split with Gaming (Planned with Tensorflow-Voice and Computer Graphics, a music game)

## Why to be a Software Developer?
I am a good hardware developer and becoming a good software developer. I The initial motivation for me to do Computer Engineering is that the people are building Vapourware! They did not actually have the thing, just a UI and win several awards with innovation. In that case, I am hoping I could be an excellent Electrical Engineer to build a nice-looking software for my hardware in order to show how hard it was to do hardware debugging, implemented in C and signal analysis.

As I began to dig in deep in software, I found it very interesting and somehow easy. Much more resources are provided for software than hardware. it made me to start doing my degree in Columbia. The crazy-load of courseworks did not kill me, however, motivated me to be excellent in every aspect I have learnt. I tried with SQL and NoSQL DB and begin to aware that the performance is the core feature that we need to do data storage, will do more performance study. I think currently myself, is qualified for an internship in Web/App development. In the future, I believe I will be a hard-core Software developer.
