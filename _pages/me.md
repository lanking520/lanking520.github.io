# Who Am I?

My name is Qing Lan, a Graduated Software/Mechatronics Engineer. I have received my First Class Honor from University of Liverpool with an additional Awards (with 100 Pounds) for best Final Year Project. Currently I am doing my degree in Columbia University in the area of Computer Engineering. I was a Research Assistant in Internet Real-Time Lab, Columbia University from 2016 to 2017. I am now a Machine Learning Intern in NVIDIA specifically working on NLP

## Personal Evaluation

### Skill set
- Programming Language: Java(Strict coding), JavaScript(hard to say), C/C++ (Electrical Engineer Level), Python(for fun)
- Android App Development: Java, XML in Android Studio. Solution: EventBus Architecture
- Web App Development: JQuery, AngularJS (Preferred), NodeJS(with express), Python Flask
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Data scraping: Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, requests, my personal HTTP library

### Fast learner
- 72 hours: Solve Physics/Math modelling problem in a team and won several prizes
- a week: Build up a web scrapy model scraping a website with not much security stuff.
- a month: Design a small Database system with complete Front End and Back End. Build up a 3D printer from scratch
- a year: Manipulate a robotic arm with several sensors in a multithreading system of the networks.

### Good in team
- Like to talk with members and love to cooperate
- Never be late in every meeting and a good timekeeper
- Always meet the deadline
- Leading several events (Lead of 2016 NASA Space APP Liverpool Location)

- Sensing Touch Robotic System (Final Year Project, ROS nodes receiving data, TCP/UDP Communication analysis, Server/Client, Multi-threading)

## Why to be a Software Developer?
I am a good hardware developer and becoming a good software developer. I The initial motivation for me to do Computer Engineering is that the people are building Vapourware! They did not actually have the thing, just a UI and win several awards with innovation. In that case, I am hoping I could be an excellent Electrical Engineer to build a nice-looking software for my hardware in order to show how hard it was to do hardware debugging, implemented in C and signal analysis.

As I began to dig in deep in software, I found it very interesting and somehow easy. Much more resources are provided for software than hardware. it made me to start doing my degree in Columbia. The crazy-load of courseworks did not kill me, however, motivated me to be excellent in every aspect I have learnt. I tried with SQL and NoSQL DB and begin to aware that the performance is the core feature that we need to do data storage, will do more performance study. I think currently myself, is qualified for an internship in Web/App development. In the future, I believe I will be a hard-core Software developer.
